- **Date:** October 18, 2025
- **Technology Stack:** ASP.NET Core MVC, Entity Framework Core, SQLite

---

## Testing Mission

**Each group is tasked to perform happy path testing to complete Backend and Frontend integration.**

### What is Happy Path Testing?

Happy path testing focuses on testing the **normal, expected flow** of the application when everything works as intended. This type of testing ensures that:

- ✅ All core features function correctly under ideal conditions
- ✅ Backend and Frontend components integrate seamlessly
- ✅ Data flows properly between all layers of the application
- ✅ User interactions produce expected results
- ✅ API endpoints return correct responses
- ✅ Database operations maintain data integrity

### Why Happy Path Testing?

1. **Foundation Testing:** Establishes that the basic functionality works
2. **Integration Validation:** Ensures BE and FE work together properly
3. **User Experience:** Verifies the application meets user expectations
4. **Quality Assurance:** Builds confidence in the system's reliability
5. **Documentation:** Creates a baseline for future testing phases

### Scope of Testing

This testing phase covers:

- **Authentication System:** Login/logout functionality
- **Product Management:** CRUD operations for products
- **Inventory Management:** Stock adjustments and tracking
- **Category Management:** Admin-only category CRUD operations
- **API Endpoints:** RESTful API functionality with proper authorization
- **User Interface:** MVC views and user interactions
- **Database Operations:** Data persistence and retrieval
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Admin vs Staff permissions

### Success Criteria

The testing is considered successful when:

- ✅ All test cases pass without critical failures
- ✅ Backend and Frontend integration works seamlessly
- ✅ Data integrity is maintained throughout all operations
- ✅ User experience is smooth and intuitive
- ✅ API responses are accurate and consistent
- ✅ Role-based access control works properly
- ✅ No major defects are discovered
