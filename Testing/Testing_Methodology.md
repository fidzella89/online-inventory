### Step 5: Prepare Test Data

**Purpose:** Ensure consistent, reliable data for testing scenarios.

**Data Requirements:**
- 5 sample products across different categories
- 6 product categories
- 2 user accounts (Admin and Staff)
- Initial inventory transactions

**Activities:**
- Verify seed data is loaded
- Create additional test data if needed
- Validate data integrity
- Document data setup procedures

**Data Verification:**
- [ ] 5 products visible in product list
- [ ] 6 categories available in dropdowns
- [ ] Admin and Staff accounts can login
- [ ] Inventory transactions are recorded

---

### Step 6: Execute Test Cases

**Purpose:** Run all test cases systematically and record results.

**Execution Guidelines:**
- Execute tests in logical order
- Record actual results for each test
- Document any deviations from expected outcomes
- Take screenshots for evidence
- Note any environmental issues

**Activities:**
- Run each test case step-by-step
- Record actual outcomes
- Document observations
- Identify any issues or defects

**Recording Format:**
| Test Case ID | Status | Actual Outcome | Notes |
|--------------|--------|----------------|-------|
| TC-001 | Pass/Fail | [Detailed result] | [Any observations] |

---

### Step 7: Verify Expected Outcomes

**Purpose:** Compare actual results with expected outcomes and identify discrepancies.

**Verification Process:**
- Compare actual vs expected results
- Identify any failures or deviations
- Document root causes of failures
- Validate data integrity after each test

**Activities:**
- Review each test result
- Identify patterns in failures
- Validate data consistency
- Document findings

**Key Areas to Verify:**
- User interface displays correctly
- Data is saved and retrieved properly
- API responses match specifications
- Error handling works as expected
- Performance meets requirements
