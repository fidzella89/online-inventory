## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Environment Setup
1. Ensure application is built and running
2. Verify database is created and migrated
3. Confirm seed data is loaded

```bash
cd [ProjectDirectory]
dotnet restore
dotnet ef database update
dotnet run
```

### Step 2: Prepare Test Data
1. Open `TestDataPreparation.md`
2. Follow verification steps
3. Create required test-specific data
4. Document any additional data created

### Step 3: Execute Tests
1. Open `TestCases_HappyPath.md`
2. Execute tests in order (TC-001 through TC-033)
3. Record results in the test case document
4. Log any defects found

### Step 4: Report Results
1. Copy `TestExecutionReport_Template.md` to a new file (e.g., `TestExecutionReport_2025-10-17.md`)
2. Fill in all sections with actual results
3. Calculate metrics and pass rates
4. Add observations and recommendations
5. Obtain sign-offs

## 📝 Best Practices

### During Test Execution

1. **Test in Order:** Execute tests sequentially (TC-001 → TC-033)
2. **Document Everything:** Record actual results, even if they pass
3. **Take Screenshots:** Capture evidence for both passes and failures
4. **Note Observations:** Record anything unusual, even if not a failure
5. **Test Data Integrity:** Verify data state after each test
6. **Clean Up:** Remove test data between runs if needed

### When Logging Defects

1. **Be Specific:** Include exact steps to reproduce
2. **Include Evidence:** Attach screenshots, error messages, logs
3. **Severity Assessment:** Assign appropriate severity level
4. **Impact Analysis:** Note which features are affected
5. **Environment Details:** Record OS, browser, versions, etc.

## 🐛 Defect Severity Guidelines

| Severity | Definition | Examples |
|----------|------------|----------|
| **Critical** | System crash, data loss, security breach | Database corruption, unhandled exceptions |
| **High** | Core feature broken, no workaround | Cannot create products, orders fail |
| **Medium** | Feature impaired but workaround exists | Sorting doesn't work, but manual filter works |
| **Low** | Minor issue, cosmetic, enhancement | Typo, alignment issue, color mismatch |
